Coverage summary and instructions

Partial coverage was generated from a focused run of the core tests and the artifacts are saved in `report/coverage/`.

Summary (local run 2025-11-13):

- All files: 63.23% statements, 34.73% branches, 56.89% functions, 64.43% lines

Files to inspect:

- `report/coverage/index.html` — full HTML report (open in a browser)
- `report/coverage/lcov.info` — lcov file for CI/reporting

Notes:

- The run was limited to the main test file (`src/hooks/usePemesanan.test.tsx`) to keep execution fast for the laporan.
- To regenerate full coverage locally, run:

```pwsh
npm run coverage
```

If you prefer, I can update the main `README.md` to include this summary and a link to `report/coverage/` — confirm and I'll patch `README.md` in-place.
